# The Crispy Broccoli Adventures
The Crispy Broccoli Adventures is a realtime coffee-break roguelike about
venturing into a dungeon and retrieving a piece of your favourite snack: crispy
broccoli.

## How to play
Use the arrow keys or hjkl to move around. Avoid the (red) grues, be careful
around traps, find the (green) piece of crispy broccoli and safely escape the
dungeon with it.

## Design goals
The Crispy Broccoli Adventures is not meant to become a full-fledged roguelike
such as [Nethack](http://nethack.org). Instead, it is meant to be a simple game
to waste a few minutes of time with, the learning curve kept as small as
possible.

## Features
- A randomly generated dungeon
- Enemies chasing you
- Traps
- A piece of crispy broccoli

## Installation
### Debian (Testing and later)

        # apt install libtcod-dev libtcod0
        $ make

You will now have a cripsy-broccoli binary in the root of the project
